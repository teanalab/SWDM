ACT I  PROLOGUE  Two households,
both alike in dignity, In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star-cross'd
lovers take their life; Whose misadventured piteous overthrows Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love, And the continuance of their parents' rage, Which,
but their children's end, nought could remove, Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage; The which if you with
patient ears attend, What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend. SCENE I. Verona. A public place.  Enter
SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers SAMPSON Gregory, o' my word,
we'll not carry coals. GREGORY No, for then we should be colliers. SAMPSON I mean, an we be in choler,
we'll draw. GREGORY Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar. SAMPSON I strike quickly, being moved.
GREGORY But thou art not quickly moved to strike. SAMPSON A dog of the house of Montague moves me. GREGORY To
move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand: therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away. SAMPSON A dog of
that house shall move me to stand: I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's. GREGORY That shows thee
a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the wall. SAMPSON True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids to the
wall. GREGORY The quarrel is between our masters and us their men. SAMPSON 'Tis all one, I will show myself a
tyrant: when I have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids, and cut off their heads. GREGORY The
heads of the maids? SAMPSON Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; take it in what sense thou wilt.
GREGORY They must take it in sense that feel it. SAMPSON Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and 'tis
known I am a pretty piece of flesh. GREGORY 'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor
John. Draw thy tool! here comes two of the house of the Montagues. SAMPSON My naked weapon is out: quarrel,
I will back thee. GREGORY How! turn thy back and run? SAMPSON Fear me not. GREGORY No, marry; I fear thee!
SAMPSON Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin. GREGORY I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it
as they list. SAMPSON Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear
it. Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR  ABRAHAM Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? SAMPSON I do bite my thumb,
sir. ABRAHAM Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? SAMPSON [Aside to GREGORY] Is the law of our side, if I say ay?
GREGORY No. SAMPSON No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I bite my thumb, sir. GREGORY Do you
quarrel, sir? ABRAHAM Quarrel sir! no, sir. SAMPSON If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
